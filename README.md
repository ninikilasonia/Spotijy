# SpotiJy

In this homework, you should create a simple song manager program - SpotiJy. It can be
used to store data about songs, albums, and artists, and update it according to users
activities.
In this task you have to implement several classes - Song, Album ,Artist and SpotiJy Each of
them is responsible for storing and/or managing a particular part of the data.
# Song
At first, you should implement Song class, as song is the smallest data entity in our software.
Each song should be described with following attributes:
title - Title
releaseYear - Release year
duration - Duration in seconds
likes - Amount of likes (Just a number, measuring the popularity)
All 4 attributes should be private and should have getter methods (String getTitle(), int
getReleaseYear(), int getDuration(), int getLikes()). Also, you should implement a
constructor to create Song objects.set 60 as a default value for the duration of the song and 0
for the likes. Hint:You have to create more than one constructor
Example
#All 3 are valid examples of creating a song:
Song rattlestarSong = new Song('Snake Jazz', 1989)
Song majorSong = new Song('Space Oddity', 1969, 315)
Song queenSong = new Song('Teo Torriatte', 1977, 355, 132178)
Since some songs can be cropped or extended,you have to provide setter function boolean
changeDuration(int duration) for duration attribute as well, which returns false if the given
parameter is less than 0, more than 720 or same as it was before. Otherwise, it should return
true and set duration attribute equal to a new value.
Instead of creating a single setter method, you should create void like() and void unlike()
methods to manage the changes in song's popularity. When called like() should increase
likes amount by 1 and unlike() should decrease it by 1.
Caveat: song's like counter shouldn't be below 0.
Song rattlestarSong = new Song('Snake Jazz', 1989)
snakeJazz.getReleaseYear() # 1989
#By default, likes are 0, it increases by 1 when `like()` is called
snakeJazz.getLikes() # 0
snakeJazz.like()
snakeJazz.getLikes() # 1
#Duration is 60 by default
snakeJazz.getDuration() # 60
snakeJazz.setDuration(90)
snakeJazz.getDuration() # 90
String toString() - override public method and output Song instance in the following
format: ### Title: <title>, Duration: , Release year: , Likes: where durationInMinutes is
duration converted into minutes.

It could be because i didn't use Bubble or
MergeSort, or its probably because someone
who wrote testing algorithm forgot to add them.
Either way my code works perfectly fine in InteliJ

Example
>>> Song snakeJazz = new Song('Snake Jazz', 1989, 30)
>>> write(snakeJazz.toString())
Title:Snake Jazz,Duration:0.5 minutes,Release year:1989,Likes:0
Note that the duration time is converted in minutes (30 -> 0.5). You should follow the exact
format. There should not be extra whitespaces or other symbols in the string.
# Album
Next, you should create a class Album to store the collection of songs in one object. The
albums should have the following attributes:
title - Title
releaseYear - The Year it was released
songs - A collection of songs, represented as an array of Song objects.
All 3 attributes should be private and should have getter methods (String getTitle(), int
getReleaseYear(), Songs[] getSongs()).
The Album class should have a constructor that takes title and release year as arguments and
initializes appropriate attributes.
int addSongs(Song[] songs) - the procedure takes song array as an argument and adds
them to the 'songs' collection. If the song is already contained in the collection, no duplicate
append should occur. After songs are added, return the number of new songs appended.
to compare two songs,go back to the Song class and override public method boolean
isEqual(Song other): Two songs are considered to be the same if they have exact same title,
release year and duration. For example, these 3 songs are considered to be same - Song('My
Song', 2011, 120, 1570), Song('My Song', 2011, 120, 1570), Song('My Song', 2011, 120,
7500) . While these 3 are different from each other - Song('My Song', 2011, 120, 450),
Song('Other Song', 2011, 120, 150), Song('My Song', 2011, 50, 450).
Example
>>> Album greenSide = new Album("Green side",1976)
>>> greenSide.getTitle()
"Green side"
>>> # One song is added to the album
>>> greenSide.addSongs({snakeJazz})
1
>>> # 2 songs are provided, but one of them is already part of the album
>>> greenSide.addSongs({snakeJazz, majorSong})
1
>>> greenSide.addSongs({repeatedSong, newSong, repeatedSong})
2
Song[] shuffle() - returns the songs from 'songs' collection in random order. You can use
random class provided by java.
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html)
Song[] sortByTitle(boolean isAscending) - returns the songs sorted by the lexicographical
comparison of song titles. if isAscending is false, return the songs in descending order.
Song[] sortByDuration(boolean isAscending) - returns the songs sorted by the comparison
of song Durations. if isAscending is false, return the songs in descending order.
Song[] sortByReleaseYear(boolean isAscending) - returns the songs sorted by the
comparison of song release years. if isAscending is false, return the songs in descending
order.
Song[] sortByPopularity(boolean isAscending) - returns the songs sorted by the
comparison of popularity(likes). if isAscending is false, return the songs in descending order.
static Song[] reverse(Song[] songs) - static function,which reverses the order of the
passed array and returns.
And lastly, for this class, implement a String toString() function, which is just a textual
representation of the album in the following format - 'Title:{title},Release year:{release
year},songs:{{song1}|{song2}|{song3}…}'. See examples for more details:
Example
Album with no songs:
>>> Album greenSide = new Album("Green side",1976)
>>> write(greenSide.toString())
`Title:`Green side,Release year:1976,songs:{}
Album with a single song:
>>> Song snakeJazz = new Song('Snake Jazz', 1989, 30)
>>>
>>> Album greenSide = new Album("Green side",1976)
>>> greenSide.addSongs(snakeJazz)
>>> write(greenSide)
`Title:`Green side,Release year:1976,songs:{Title:Snake Jazz,Duration:0.5
minutes,Release year:1989,Likes:0}
Album with multiple songs:
>>> Song snakeJazz = new Song('Snake Jazz', 1989, 30)
>>> Song majorSong = new Song('Space Oddity', 1969, 60, 12000)
>>>
>>> Album greenSide = new Album("Green side",1976)
>>> greenSide.addSongs(snakeJazz)
>>> write(greenSide)
Title:Green side,Release year:1976,songs:{Title:Snake Jazz,Duration:0.5
minutes,Release year:1989,Likes:0|Title:Space Oddity,Duration:1
minutes,Release year:1969,Likes:12000}
# Artist
The Artist is the last entity class to implement. The artist should have the following
attributes:
firstName - A first name
lastName - A last name
birthYear - The year person was born in
albums - The collection of albums, represented as an array of Album objects
singles - The list of songs (That are not part of any albums and are released seperately)
represeted as an array of Song objects.
All 5 attributes should be private and should have getter methods (String getFirstName(),
String getSecondName(), int getBirthYear(), Album []getAlbums(), Song[] getSingles()).
Furthermore you should create a several methods in Artist class.
Create a method called Song mostLikedSong(),which will return the most liked song of the
artist. Note: your function should compare all the songs from singles and all the albums.
Create a method called Song leastLikedSong() which behaves in the same way as Song
mostLikedSong() method, but instead of the most popular song, it returns the least popular
one.
Create a method int totalLikes() which returns the total number of likes for this artist.
Again, consider all songs from the albums and singles.
Creates a method boolean isEqual(Artist other) - compares two artists.2 Artist objects ar
considered to be the same, if they have the same first name, last name and birth year.
And at the end, String toString() method should be implemented as well. It should return
the following representation of the artist: 'Name: {firstName} {lastName},Birth year:
{birthYear},Total likes:{total likes of this artist}'. Note: '{' and '}' are used to mark values and
should not be part of the final output and string representation of the artist does not include
albums and singles.
# SpotiJy
This is the final and the main class of this software - SpotiJy.
SpotiJy has a single hidden (private) attribute artists - a collection of artist, represented as
an array of Artist objects. A constructor does not take any arguments and should initialize
artists with an empty array.
Furthermore, SpotiJy should have following methods:
Artist[] getArtists() - Returns the array of of artists.
void addArtists(Artist[] artists) - Adds Artist objects to the list, if they are not
already in the list.
String [] getTopTrendingArtist() - Returns the array of the first name and the last
name (['john', 'doe']) of the artist that has the most likes - sum of likes from all song
from all albums and singles.
String getTopTrendingAlbum() - Returns the name of the album with the most total
likes - sum of like of all songs in this album. It should compare all albums in all artists.
String getTopTrendingSong() - Returns the name of the song with the most likes. It
should consider all the songs in all artists albums or singles.
